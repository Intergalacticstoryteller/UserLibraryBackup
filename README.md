# UserLibraryBackup
These Simple Scripts are used for backing up a PC's user Libraries.

You must update the directories to fit your needs. The backup directory can be left alone unless you want to back up a specific user profile. 

To run, open CMD and navigate to the file's directory, then type the file name including file extention. 

This script assumes you are on a domain with r/w privilages. If not, you will not have access.
